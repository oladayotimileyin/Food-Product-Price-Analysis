# Food Prices Analysis

Let's say hypothetically, I am looking to move into any of these cities, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, or Atlanta. 

As a food lover, I am interested in how much it will **cost** me on average to get groceries in these cities and the prices of the most common groceries.

This project therefore provides insight into average retail prices of groceries in these cities and their percentage spread (percentage difference between retail price and farm price).

The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/everydaycodings/produce-prices-dataset) was obtained from Kaggle and spanned between 1999 to 2019. 

You can view the dashboard [here](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiYTFjMzQwZDQtMzY4Ni00MThiLWJkOGItMmNjNjQ5OGNmNzM3IiwidCI6ImRmODY3OWNkLWE4MGUtNDVkOC05OWFjLWM4M2VkN2ZmOTVhMCJ9.)

Please feel free to comment and suggest any improvements.

Thank you so much
